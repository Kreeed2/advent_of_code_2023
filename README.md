# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles. Each year, Advent of Code challenges participants to write code to solve a series of small programming puzzles, released one per day over the course of 25 days in December.

## Current Year Solutions

This repository currently contains solutions for the [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) Advent of Code puzzles. I will be adding solutions for previous years as I complete them.

## Solution Structure

Each day's puzzles are organized into a separate directory named after the day, e.g., `day_1`. Each puzzle directory contains two files:

* `input_1.txt`: The puzzle input data for today's puzzle
* `part_1_1.rs`: My solution to today's puzzle in the specified programming language

## Language Support

I currently support solutions in the following programming languages:

* Rust
